**Hello World!**

I am a software tester with automation skills. I'm at the beginning of my journey in the IT world, and this is where I'll be showcasing examples of what I've been working on and the direction in which I've been training. Here, you'll find both projects written according to the guidelines from the courses I've taken, as well as my own original projects that I decided to pursue.

**TechStack**:
I spent many hours with Java language, I have spent many hours with the Java language + Selenium WebDrivers, which is currently the programming language I am most proficient in. In the past, I have also written small projects using the Swift language and XCode software. However, my knowledge of programming in Java is not limited to the use of the Selenium libraries. Before deciding to focus on test automation, I was preparing to work as a Java programmer. Of course, in preparing for writing automated tests, I couldn't ignore manual testing, examples of which will also be available on this profile. These are two complementary methods of ensuring software quality.
